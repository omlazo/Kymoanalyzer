# Kymoanalyzer
These macros were originally made by the group of Sandra Encalada at The Scripps Research Institute, here they are with little modifications to fit our experimental assumptions and the FIJI version currently in use (solving dependency on other plugins, etc.).

I have prepared a quick guide to remind myself my own protocol of use, but for further reference please check the original manual has (also included). More information can be found in: https://www.encalada.scripps.edu/kymoanalyzer 

If you use KymoAnalyzer in a publication, please cite the article in which the software was described:
Neumann S, Chassefeyre R, Campbell GE, Encalada SE. KymoAnalyzer: a software tool for the quantitative analysis of intracellular transport in neurons. Traffic, 2017 Jan;18(1):71-88. doi: 10.1111/tra.12456. Epub 2016 Dec 11.

Encalada's lab encourage users to modify the open source code and/or develop plugins/macros to extend the applicability of KymoAnalyzer to the analysis of various datasets, including combining this with particle detection/tracking algorithms. If you modify the KymoAnalyzer, please contact them (encalada@scripps.edu) so new plugins/macros and the respective documentation can be added to their website.
